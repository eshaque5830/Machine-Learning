"   Given all the negative reviews about PIA, I was nervous about what my experience would be like. It really wasn't bad at all though. Check-in and boarding in LHE was a little chaotic, no announcements or anything for boarding - people just queued up and waited for boarding to commence. Flight was about 30 minutes late with boarding. Onboard PIA A320s dont have PTVs so you should either bring a book or your laptop. They served an inflight meal shortly after takeoff, food was really not bad. Flight attendants were overall very helpful and kind and they were present throughout the 3 1/2 hour flight to give out water or other beverages. We landed approximately 20 minutes behind schedule so no major issues.

  I flew from Karachi to Toronto on PIA 777-200LR. The seats very comfortable and the leg room was amazing. Cabin crew was very friendly and kept on serving refreshments. The food is delicious. The best part is that it is the only non stop flight from Pakistan to Canada which is very convenient and saves a lot of time. The only drawbacks are that the IFE doesn’t work except for the flight map and there are no charging ports. , I flew from Karachi to Toronto on PIA LR The seats very comfortable and the leg room was amazing Cabin crew was very friendly and kept on serving refreshments The food is delicious The best part is that it is the only non stop flight from Pakistan to Canada which is very convenient and saves a lot of time The only drawbacks are that the IFE doesn t work except for the flight map and there are no charging ports ,"[('flew', 'v'), ('Karachi', 'n'), ('Toronto', 'n'), ('PIA', 'n'), ('LR', 'n'), ('seats', 'n'), ('comfortable', 'a'), ('leg', 'n'), ('room', 'n'), ('amazing', 'v'), ('Cabin', 'n'), ('crew', 'n'), ('friendly', 'a'), ('kept', 'v'), ('serving', 'v'), ('refreshments', 'n'), ('food', 'n'), ('delicious', 'a'), ('best', 'a'), ('part', 'n'), ('non', 'a'), ('stop', 'v'), ('flight', 'n'), ('Pakistan', 'n'), ('Canada', 'n'), ('convenient', 'a'), ('saves', 'v'), ('lot', 'n'), ('time', 'n'), ('drawbacks', 'n'), ('IFE', 'n'), ('work', 'n'), ('except', None), ('flight', 'n'), ('map', 'n'), ('charging', 'v'), ('ports', 'n')]",  fly Karachi Toronto PIA LR seat comfortable leg room amaze Cabin crew friendly keep serve refreshment food delicious best part non stop flight Pakistan Canada convenient save lot time drawback IFE work except flight map charge port,0.9633,Positive

"  Birmingham to Islamabad. I am severely disgusted in PIA for the way in which they have handled the crisis of COVID-19.

"  Birmingham to Islamabad. Travelled Premium Economy - meaning you travel in the old Business Class seats but get none of the other extras that you would expect on other airlines.

When checking suddenly informed, only 2 pieces of luggage allowable! Check in lady advises we cling wrap two suitcases together. Much tooing and froing getting the weights ok then spending £17 on clingwrap. Only to be told that the luggage was now deemed ""overweight"" so we had to take to outsize counter! Dragged them there. By now, no time to visit free lounge was at far end of terminal. Onboard seats comfortable and extendable to near flat. Service was good, with attentive and polite staff. Food acceptable, and large portions but preferred my Pret baguette I had purchased in the terminal. No entertainment, nothing! If you could put the screen on, all the channels are blank! Make sure you bring your own screens with you and plenty of power banks as there no plug points.

  Manchester to Islamabad - check in at airport was fast and organised. Inside the plane it had very dated cabin look. Blankets and cushions were available. It was a full flight. One of the toilet did not work and was flooded. Cabin crew had no manners and were rather rude. Dinner was tasty and breakfast was also good. Landed 30 minutes ahead of schedule which was great.

"  Islamabad to London. We enrolled to become award members, and upgraded to business class seats on our outward bound flight from Heathrow to Islamabad. My husband was suffering shoulder and neck pain and I from lower back pain. We arrived at the boarding gate and were told to wait in the corridor as the seating area was full, looking inside we saw that some passengers were using the seats to put their luggage on, we insisted on being able to get into the seated waiting area and eventually were allowed to go in , once there we asked the passengers to remove the luggage from the seat and let us sit down. The seats in the aeroplane are old style and were not fully functional, they would go flat but we were unable to sit up as they would not pull up enough. We asked the steward to help sort them out they were unable to do so and could not offer alternative seats. They were unable to provide extra pillow or blankets, as they claimed they only carried a limited amount. The food was reasonable but not really presented as one would expect in business class. Having travelled on other airlines business class this fell very short in service and comfort. The cutlery was plastic - really is that the best they can do?? There was no in flight entertainment or newspapers offered. The icing on the cake for this journey was having to wait for our luggage over 2 and a half hours even economy collected their baggage before us. We visited Saddar PIA office and spoke to the Shabbir duty manager there to complain about the service we received, we were told to make a formal written complaint and someone will be in touch within a day or two. Having done this we waited and waited for a response. Needless to say no one called to offer any explanation or any form of remedy. We were seeking to upgrade on our return journey but they were unable to do that as they claimed there system was in the process of being upgraded. Still after a few days no one contacted us. Their phone system is useless we tried calling only to be left hanging on the phone for hours. Eventually you get through and the call attendees cut you off. After a few days we then went into the Islamabad office saw the duty manager to see if we can upgrade, only to be told they are unable to do that as all business class seats are full and their system was not allowing them to upgrade. They checked us in to seats 1A and 1C and gave us paperwork to confirm our seat allocation, No sufficient explanation or compensation was offered for the journey we had already been on. Fresh return tickets in hand. We arrived at the airport in ISB, only to find that the counter clerk had changed the seats allocated saying that they were wrongly allocated by the duty manager at PIA office ISB and he referred the

" London to Islamabad. You will be where I have been, when booking tickets. You use a ticket scanner site and find the cheapest ticket you can for a flight to Pakistan. You see the price of business class on PIA and its half the price of any of the competitors. You say 'wow, ill book that'. This is what you get. Ancient planes with broken seats, scuffed and dirty. No IFE. Screens don't work. This was both ways. Seat didn't work. When the airlines say lie flat seat, you assume when its working it lies flat. Basically for the price, you get a wider seat and more leg room. Food was tasty and plentiful, despite being served from foil trays, and eaten with plastic forks. Staff were average. Some were excellent, some were miserable and offish. No priority boarding or bag tags. I waited 50 mins at Heathrow to collect my bag. I travel business most weeks somewhere in the world.

" I was surprised to see Pakistan Intl flying from Tokyo to Beijing so cheaply, so I booked, thinking the flight would be rather short so there would be no room for grave errors. I found out that this is part of a longer itinerary; the plane leaves Beijing and is bound for Lahore and Islamabad. When checking in, I was given an odd boarding pass without a boarding gate or departure time written on it. I was told not to clear security and to await a staff announcement. At least fifteen minutes after the scheduled departure time, it was announced (only in Japanese) that the plane could not depart. While I am lucky to have years of experience with the Japanese language, the Danish travellers in front of me were not so lucky. Overall, the ensuing process on the ground was appallingly disorganized. Although we were asked to neatly line up to receive replacement flights, many people just ended up cutting straight to the front of the line and snatching the best flights. Observing this led the line to dissolve, with a survival-of-the-fittest situation emerging. The airline gave me a flight from Haneda with Air China free of charge. I spent the night with at a friend's, and it was unclear whether they would cover non-Narita hotel costs. Overall, save yourself the trouble.

Toronto. The ground crew at the airline counter displayed attitude and lacked any courtesy. The food quality on the way to Lahore was just acceptable. On return to Toronto the food portions were not even enough to feed a 6 year old. Also the breakfast was served one hour after takeoff and then no food until next 8 hours. That too was not enough. There was no food/snack/beverage for next 7 hours. 70% of Pakistanis living in North America drink coffee. Coffee was not available for economy class. No more PIA.
